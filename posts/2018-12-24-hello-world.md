On October 8th 2018, [Google announced](https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/) that they would be sunsetting (turning off) Google+, effective August 31, 2019. While I wasn't an avid Google+ user, I *did* use it as an informal place to post links and articles I found useful. Then, on December 10th, [Google announced](https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/) that they were moving up their timetable to sunset Google+ to April 2019.

So that left me with a handful of old links, a handful of new links, and nowhere to post them. I frequently find myself learning something new-to-me either at work or while working on personal projects, and I'd like to have a place to record them for posterity. `"Come on, John. You solve problems all day at work. This sounds like a solvable problem. Do something about it,"` I told myself. So here I am, doing something about it. I'm starting *yet another* blog.

I don't have a goal of posting on any particularly regular schedule, although I would like to work through my backlog of Google+ content before diving into newer links and content. I also don't currently have any plans for publishing these posts anywhere but the original hosting site ([Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)).
