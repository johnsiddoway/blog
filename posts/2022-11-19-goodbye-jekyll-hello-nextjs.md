title: 'Goodbye Jekyll, Hello Next.js'

When I first created this blog back in 2018, I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I was somewhat familiar with Ruby, and at the time it seemed like Jekyll was *the* static website generator for a blog. And things were technically fine. In 2022, I came across [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that provides out-of-the box support for static website generation, and pretty good documentation. My org at work was slowly adopting React and moving away from Ruby, so I thought it was also time for a change for the personal blog.

Overall, it wasn't very hard to switch from one to the other. Both frameworks were built on the idea that your blog posts are written in markdown, with some YAML Front Matter at the top. Next.js's blog tutorial is quite good, and the additional documentation on features is quite good.

## Major Changes

* Ruby vs React
* Injecting custom javascript and stylesheets on individual pages was pretty tricky in React

## Minor Changes

* I reduced the amount of metadata
* I attempted to streamline the styling a little bit
