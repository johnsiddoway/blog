# About Me

My name is John Siddoway. I have been a professional software engineer for about 15 years now. I live in the Seattle, WA, area with my wife, our three kids, and our menagerie of pets. In my scant free time, you can find me playing video games, tabletop games, or attempting to keep my classical guitar skills up to snuff.

I'm mostly writing up this blog to keep track of stuff I've been learning about in my personal time. It's not really expected to be a fount of wisdom. More of the opposite; I tend to write stuff down when I realize I was doing it poorly or flat out wrong and I want to stop repeating a mistake.
