A very defensive build, Paladin tanks aren't interested in doing more damage than they have to. The build below dedicates several talents & abilities to buffs (Exhortations) for the party, but you may find that you need to sacrifice these in order to make your Paladin even tankier.

# Gear
* Weapon: Anything that debuffs on hit, or weapons with "Coordinated Attacks" enhancement
* Shield: We dont' care about our own Accuracy, so the shield with the highest Deflection wins
* Armor: The heaviest armor you can find. Enchantments like Second Chance are good
