A very defensive build, Paladin tanks aren't interested in doing more damage than they have to. The build below dedicates several talents & abilities to buffs (Exhortations) for the party, but you may find that you need to sacrifice these in order to make your Paladin even tankier.

## Stats
Might
: 18+ *more for the bonus to healing than the bonus to damage*

Constitution
: 10

Dexterity
: 3

Perception
: 3

Intellect
: 18+

Resolve
: 18++

Paladin Order
: **Shieldbearers of St. Elcga** *They have access to a couple of order-specific abilities that are pretty awesome for tanks*

Race
: Human, Coastal Aumaua, Wild Orlan, Pale Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Fire Godlike, Moon Godlike, Nature Godlike
: *These all have bonuses that are all roughly equivalent for tanks*

Culture
: Old Vailia *Intellect*

: Whatever you want

Skills
: Lore
: Survival *for the +healing bonus*

## Talents & Abilities

1
: Lay on Hands

2
: Shieldbearers of St Elcga: Shielding Touch
: Other Orders: ?

3
: Zealous Endurance / Zealous Focus *If you have another party member take the cross-class ability, your paladin should take Endurance. It's better late game anyway, once everyone gets their own +Accuracy bonuses*

: Other Orders: Liberating Exhortation

6
: Shieldbearers of St Elcga: Shielding Flames

9
: Reinforcing Exhortation

10
: Greater Lay on Hands

11
: Hastening Exhortation

12
: Superior Deflection

13
: Sacred Immolation *too good of an ability to pass up, even as a tank*

14
: Scien of Flame *boosts Sacred Immolation, Flames of Devotion, and the Fire Godlike's passive ability*

15
: Coordinated Attacks / Abjuration / Behold the Martyr / Liberating Exhoration / Righteous Soul / Healing Chain

16
: Deep Faith

Others
: Hold the Line
: Defensive Boosts (Will, Fortitude, etc.)
: Wound Binding

## Gear

Weapon
: Anything that debuffs on hit, or weapons with "Coordinated Attacks" enhancement

Shield
: We don't care about our own Accuracy, so the shield with the highest Deflection wins

Armor
: The heaviest armor you can find. Enchantments like Second Chance are good
